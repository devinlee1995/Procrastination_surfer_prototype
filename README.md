# Procrastination_surfer_prototype

This is a prototype of a game called Procrastination Panic: Internet Edition. In order to run this code, node.js must be installed, and through the terminal, you must cd into the correct directory. Afterwards, typing in node.index.js runner_test will allow you to run the server at localhost:4242. The game can then be played on the browser.
